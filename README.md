### Detecting Spam Emails Using Tensorflow in Python

A deep learning project for classifying Emails as spam or ham using an LSTM-based neural network trained on preprocessed and balanced text data.

The initial idea and dataset were inspired by an article available on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detecting-spam-emails-using-tensorflow-in-python/), which served as a helpful starting point for understanding the fundamentals of spam detection using deep learning.
